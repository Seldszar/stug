```

## Usage

### By using default options

Open a command terminal in the folder you want to use then type the following command.

```bash
$ stug
```

### By using a custom folder

Instead of going to the folder you want to use, you can tell the program to use another one by using the `base` option.

```bash
$ stug --base=<YOUR_BASE>
```

### By using a custom host and/or port

If for some reasons you want to change the host and/or port, you can customize by using the `host` and `port` options.

```bash
$ stug --host=<YOUR_HOST> --port=<YOUR_PORT>
```
